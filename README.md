# Student Profile Dashboard
I started working on this project after we finished html class because I wanted to create something unique. I was easily able to start small and later, when my hands was a little stronger, I decided to scale further, which is why we have such a fantastic project. The main goal is to bring my altschool colleagues on board by adding their profiles, as well as to spread the opensource gospel.
