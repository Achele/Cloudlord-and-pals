          "Many people prefer open source software because they have more control over that kind of software. They can examine the code to make sure it's not doing anything they don't want it to do, and they can change parts of it they don't like. Users who aren't programmers also benefit from open source software, because they can use this software for any purpose they wish‚Äînot merely the way someone else thinks they should. .",

          "Open source software often inspires a community of users and developers to form around it. That's not unique to open source; many popular applications are the subject of meetups and user groups. But in the case of open source, the community isn't just a fanbase that buys in (emotionally or financially) to an elite user group; it's the people who produce, test, use, promote, and ultimately affect the software they love",

          "Open source isn't about saving money, it's about doing more stuff, and getting incremental innovation",

          "It helps to create diversity within contributors",
          "It's okay to feel lost sometimes",
